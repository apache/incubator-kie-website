# Drools

Drools is a set of projects focusing on intelligent automation and decision management, most notably providing a forward-chaining and backward-chaining inference-based rule engine, DMN decisions engine and other projects. A rule engine is a fundamental building block to create an expert system which, in artificial intelligence, is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.
