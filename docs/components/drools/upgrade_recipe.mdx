# Upgrade Recipe

For migration to 10.0.0 or later, please refer to the [Migration Guide](https://kie.apache.org/docs/10.0.x/drools/drools/migration-guide/index.html).

# Upgrade recipe 7.0

**KIE public API classes are backwards compatible** (per series), but users often also use implementation classes (which are documented in the reference manual too). This upgrade recipe _minimizes the pain_ to upgrade your code.

## Legend

Every upgrade note has an indication how likely your code will be affected by that change:

- **Major**: Likely to affect your code.
- **Minor**: Unlikely to affect your code (especially if you followed the examples), unless you have hacks.
- **Impl detail**: Will not affect your code, unless you have very deep hacks.
- **Recommended**: Not a backward incompatible change, but you probably want to do this.
- **Readme**: Read this to better understand why the subsequent major changes were made.

## Backwards incompatible changes to the public API

Because this is a new major version number (7.0), which is the foundation for the 7.x series for the next few years, it allows us to make backwards incompatible changes to the public API _for the long term benefit of this project_.

Our current intention is to keep these backwards incompatible changes to a strict minimum (by favoring deprecation over removal) and do not introduce any additional ones after 7.0.

Any backwards incompatible changes are annotated with a **Public API** badge.

## From 6.5.0.Final to 7.0.0.Final

### [Public API] [Major] Java 8 or higher required

If you’re using JRE or JDK 6 or 7, upgrade to JDK 8 or higher.

We currently intend to support a minimal version of Java 8 throughout the entire 7.x series.

### [Public API] [Major] OSGi integration artifacts renamed

OSGi integration artifacts were renamed from `drools-*` to `kie-*`. We have also renamed the Java package names from `org.drools.osgi` to `org.kie.osgi`. The main reason for these changes is that the artifacts no longer contain just Drools-specific code, but also jBPM and OptaPlanner OSGi integration (KIE is the umbrella term for those three projects). The change affects `drools-osgi-integration` Maven artifact, Karaf features file URL and Spring’s `OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor`:

**Before in `pom.xml`:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
  <artifactId>drools-osgi-integration</artifactId>
  <version>6.5.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

**After in `pom.xml`:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-osgi-integration</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

**Before when using Karaf features file:**
```shell
features:addurl mvn:org.drools/drools-karaf-features/6.5.0.Final/xml/features
```

**After when using Karaf features file:**
```shell
features:addurl mvn:org.kie/kie-karaf-features/7.0.0.Beta2/xml/features
```

**Before in Spring configuration file:**
```xml
<bean id="kiePostProcessor" class="org.drools.osgi.spring.OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor"/>
```

**After in Spring configuration file:**
```xml
<bean id="kiePostProcessor" class="org.kie.osgi.spring.OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor"/>
```

### [Public API] [Major] KIE Drools Workbench WARs renamed

The KIE Drools Workbench WARs were renamed from:
```
kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars-<version>-<container>.war
```
to:
```
kie-drools-wb-<version>-<container>.war
```
If you depend directly on the Maven GAV you need to change the `artifactId`:

**Before in `pom.xml`:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars</artifactId>
  <version>6.5.0.Final</version>
  <type>war</type>
  <classifier>wildfly10</classifier>
</dependency>
```

**After in `pom.xml`:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-drools-wb</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.0.Final</version>
  <type>war</type>
  <classifier>wildfly10</classifier>
</dependency>
```
