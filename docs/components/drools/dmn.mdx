# DMN

The Decision Model and Notation (DMN™) is a Standard by OMG® providing a common and visual notation readily understandable by all users and personas. With DMN, business analysts can define the initial decision requirements and then formalize more detailed decision models; technical developers can automate the decisions in any process with a portable execution semantic, while business stakeholders can manage and monitor those decisions.

The official webpage of the DMN Standard specification is available at [OMG website](https://www.omg.org/dmn).
Drools DMN engine is an open source Java™ implementation providing full runtime support for DMN models at Conformance level 3, meaning 100% of the features in the Standard.

## At a glance

> DMN is trying to do for Business Decision Management what BPMN did for Business Process Management a decade ago: empower the business to take charge of the logic that drives its operations, through a vendor-independent diagramming language. To be effective, that language must be both usable by business analysts and stakeholders in the business and verifiable for completeness and consistency. DMN is both.

![DMN DRG Decision Requirements Graph](dmn/DMNDRG.png)

Manage any decision complexity by decomposing and structuring decision services with Decision Requirement Graph (DRG).

![DMN Decision Table](dmn/DMNDT.png)

Model business logic with DMN Decision Table, an effective instrument understandable by all personas. Drools DMN engine performs static analysis of the DMN Decision Table to detect gaps, overlaps, and ensure the table rules follow industry best practices.

![DMN Boxed Expression](dmn/DMNBoxed.png)

Model more complex business logic with the power of all the FEEL Boxed Expression constructs made available by the DMN Standard specification.

Integrate DMN with [BPMN](https://jbpm.org) and [CMMN](https://jbpm.org) to describe an executable and semantically defined business logic to be used in business processes.

Drools DMN engine provides full runtime support for DMN models at Conformance level 3, meaning 100% of the features in the Standard.

We contribute to the [DMN Technology Compatibility Kit (DMN TCK)](https://dmn-tck.github.io/tck), a community-led proposal for a verifiable and executable method to demonstrate the Conformance level of support provided by a vendor-supplied DMN implementation.
