# Sonataflow


SonataFlow is a tool for building cloud-native workflow applications. You can use it to do the services and events orchestration and choreography. Currently, with SonataFlow you can integrate with services and events in your architecture using:

* CloudEvents. Ideal for an Event-Driven architecture where the services are ready to consume and produce events working in a more reactive way. 
* Sync or Async REST services invocations via OpenAPI/AsyncAPI. There are options even to directly call a REST service in the architecture or ecosystem. Either async or sync methods are supported depending on your requirements. 
* Internal Service execution or invocation. SonataFlow is also a workflow framework to build applications. You can use it to create custom services in the same thread to run a lightweight workflow-based application within the same instance.

You can learn how to create, manage, and deploy your workflow applications with the guides included in the [Documentation](https://kie.apache.org/docs/documentation/).
